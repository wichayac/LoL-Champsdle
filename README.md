LoL Champsdle
A Wordle-inspired guessing game for League of Legends champions.

Status: In Progress (Refactoring)

Background:
This project is a personal milestone. Originally built during my Freshman year as a basic HTML/JS exercise, I am now refactoring it as a Sophomore to implement what I've learned, better UI/UX, and real-time data integration.

The Goal: Moving from a static prototype to a production-ready web application with a focus on "Native Feel" interaction.

Refactoring Goals & Progress:
I am currently refactoring it to meet industry standards:

[ ] Direct Grid Typing: Replacing the input system with Direct Grid Typing.

[ ] Advanced UI/UX: Implementing CSS Keyframes and transitions to provide visual feedback for correct/incorrect guesses.

[ ] Dynamic Data: Moving from a hardcoded list to fetching real-time champion data via the Riot Games API.

[ ] Accessibility Engine: Developing an autocomplete suggestion system to help non-players (and recruiters!) navigate the champion names.

How to Play:
You have 6 tries to guess the mystery champion.

The champion name must be exactly 5 letters.

Visual Feedback:

Green: Letter is in the correct spot.

Yellow: Letter is in the name but in the wrong spot.

Gray: Letter is not in the name.
